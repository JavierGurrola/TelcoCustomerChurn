# Predictive Modeling: Customer Churn Prediction

Building ML classification models to predict whether a customer will leave a subscription-based service. This project demonstrates skills in classification, feature engineering, and business impact. It also includes some visualizations and summarization of insights.

- **Dataset**: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Steps**: 
  - Clean and preprocess data (e.g., handle missing values, one-hot encoding for categorical variables).
  - Build and compare classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
  - Visualize the importance of features and build a dashboard summarizing insights.
